    <p class="recipe-paragraph">Chilaquiles are basically corn tortilla pieces that are fried, cooked in salsa, and sprinkled with cheese. They are often served for breakfast with eggs and a side of beans or nopalitos.


        My mother grew up with her mother making them with green chile tomato salsa and grated longhorn cheese, a Tex Mex version.</p>
        <h2 class="recipe-h2">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 corn tortillas, preferably stale, or left out overnight to dry out a bit, quartered or cut into 6 wedges</li>
            <li>Corn oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups red chile sauce or salsa verde, store-bought or homemade (see end of recipe for homemade versions)</li>
            <li>A few sprigs of epazote, optional</li>
            <li>Cotija cheese or queso fresco</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>Crema Mexicana or creme fraiche</li>
            <li>Cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>Avocado, sliced or roughly chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="recipe-h2">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large sauté pan, coat pan generously with corn oil, (1/8 inch), heat on medium high to high. When the oil is quite hot, add the tortillas, fry until golden brown.

                Remove tortillas to a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess oil. Sprinkle a little salt on the tortillas.
                
                Wipe pan clean of any browned bits of tortillas.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of oil to pan, bring to high heat again. Add the salsa and let salsa cook for several minutes. If you have a few sprigs of epazote, add them to the salsa.</li>
            <li>Add the fried tortilla quarters to the salsa. Gently turn over the pieces of tortilla until they are all well coated with salsa. Let cook for a few minutes more.

                Remove from heat. Serve chilaquiles with garnishes and fried eggs and beans or nopalitos.</li>
            <li>Take 4 dried ancho chiles, remove seeds, stems, and veins. Heat chiles lightly on a skillet on medium heat to draw out their flavor. Put chilies in a saucepan, pour boiling hot water over to cover. Let sit for 15 minutes. Add chiles, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of chile soaking liquid to a blender. Hold down lid of blender tightly while blending, blend until completely puréed. Strain through a mesh sieve into a frying pan to make the chilaquiles.</li>
            <li>
                Put 1 pound tomatillos, husks removed, into a saucepan, cover with water by an inch. Add 1 jalapeno, stems and seeds removed. Add 2 cloves garlic. Bring to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes until tomatillos have changed color and are cooked through. Use slotted spoon to remove tomatillos, jalapeno and garlic to a blender. Add a cup of the cooking liquid. Blend until completely puréed. Add salt to taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
