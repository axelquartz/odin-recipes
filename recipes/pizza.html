    <p>It’s quick, it’s easy, and it’s foolproof. And it makes two pizza balls so you can make both for pizza night, make one and save the other, or freeze both as needed. IT IS ALL GOOD.

        Top with all your desired toppings. I like to keep mine classic with fresh mozzarella, parmigiano-reggiano, and basil but honestly, anything goes!</p>
