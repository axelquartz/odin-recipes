    <p>A torta ahogada (or ‘drowned sandwich’ in English) is a Mexican sandwich made from a crusty bread roll that’s filled with pork carnitas and red onions. It’s dipped or “drowned” in a red chile sauce and served with fresh lime wedges.

    This sandwich is especially popular in the Mexican city of Guadalajara, Jalisco where it’s sold in countless restaurants and by street vendors.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Carnitas</li>
            <li>Red Onions</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Chile de Arbol Peppers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you’ll need to make the sauce. Start by placing the dried chiles in boiling water until they softened. Then, roast the tomatoes under the broiler or over an open flame until the skins begin to blister and blacken.

            Add the roasted tomatoes, softened chiles, and the remaining sauce ingredients to a blender and puree until smooth. Lightly cook the sauce in a saucepan with some olive oil until it starts to simmer. This will deepen the flavor of the sauce even more and cook out any strong raw onion flavors.</li>
            <li>Next, assemble the sandwiches by stuffing each roll with a generous amount of carnitas and sliced onions. Place them bowls (a pasta bowl is great for this) or a plate with deep sides that can hold a good amount of liquid. Generously pour the sauce on top of each sandwich and enjoy!</li>
